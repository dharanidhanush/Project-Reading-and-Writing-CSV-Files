## ðŸ§  Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to read and write CSV files using Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` module. It includes four core functions that handle different ways of representing and manipulating tabular data:

- `read_csv_fieldnames(filename)`  
- `read_csv_as_list_dict(filename)`  
- `read_csv_as_nested_dict(filename, keyfield)`  
- `write_csv_from_list_dict(filename, table, fieldnames)`

Each function is designed to work with real-world datasets and supports flexible data access for analysis and reporting.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included  
- `csv_project_dharani.py` â€“ Main Python file with all required functions and unit tests  
- `students.csv` â€“ Sample CSV file used for testing (auto-generated by the script)  
- `README.md` â€“ This documentation file  

---
ðŸ§ª Testing and Validation  
The script includes a built-in test function `test_csv_functions()` that:
- Writes a sample dataset to `students.csv`
- Validates all four functions using assertions
- Confirms correct behavior with a success message

To run the tests, simply execute the script:

```bash
python csv_project_dharani.py
```

Expected output:

```
âœ… All tests passed successfully!
```

ðŸ§¼ Style and Documentation  
- All functions include docstrings for clarity  
- Code follows consistent indentation and naming conventions  
- Comments are provided to guide student understanding

 ðŸ“ˆ Learning Outcomes  
- Understand how to represent tabular data using dictionaries and lists  
- Gain hands-on experience with file I/O and structured data formats  
- Build reusable functions for data analysis workflows
